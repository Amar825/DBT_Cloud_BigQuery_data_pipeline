## 🧱 Architecture Diagram

This project follows a modular and automated data engineering architecture on Google Cloud.  
Raw synthetic healthcare data is generated and stored in GCS, externalized into BigQuery, transformed via DBT models, and deployed through CI/CD using GitHub Actions.

## 🔁 Step-by-Step Workflow

### 4.1 GCP Setup
- Created GCP project
- Configured IAM roles and Service Accounts
- Enabled BigQuery & GCS

### 4.2 BigQuery Datasets & GCS Buckets
- Created `dev_healthcare_data` and `prod_healthcare_data`
- Created GCS bucket `healthcare-data-bucket-*`

### 4.3 Data Generation & Upload
- Wrote Python script using `Faker` and `Pandas`
- Generated realistic healthcare data (patients, EHR, claims)
- Uploaded CSV, JSON, Parquet to GCS

### 4.4 External Table Creation
- Used BigQuery to create external tables from GCS
- Formats: CSV (patients), JSON (EHR), Parquet (claims)

### 4.5 DBT Modeling
- Built staging (`stg_`) and core (`fct_`, `dim_`) models
- Used `source()` and `ref()` for lineage and modularity

### 4.6 Testing & Documentation
- Added `schema.yml` for column-level tests (`not_null`, `unique`)
- Used `dbt test`, `dbt docs generate`, `dbt docs serve`

### 4.7 CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- `ci.yml`: runs `dbt test` on pull requests
- `cd.yml`: deploys models to prod on merge to `main`
- Injected GCP credentials via GitHub Secrets

### 4.8 Deployment to Production
- All models deployed to `prod_healthcare_data` via GitHub Actions
- Fully automated and version-controlled

### 4.9 Scheduled Jobs & Looker Dashboard
- Scheduled DBT builds (daily)
- Created interactive dashboards in Looker Studio
